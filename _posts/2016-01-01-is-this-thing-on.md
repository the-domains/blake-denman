# Is This Thing On?

It's January 1st, 2016\. I'm at our new office working on our goals and plans for 2016\. 

"A goal without a plan is just a wish" - Antoine de Saint-Exupery

Come February, I will have been in business for 7 years. Never did I think that I would own a successful business. The company I own is called RicketyRoo. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d89d4ac5-af94-43c8-b846-36ae0738b26e.png)

[RicketyRoo][0] offers digital marketing solutions for small to medium sized businesses. We are proudly located in Bend Oregon.

Up until a few years ago, I never really had the intention of growing the business outside of myself. I was comfortable doing the work and having a good time doing it.

I then realized that 20 years from now I don't want to be doing the same day-to-day work. I decided to start growing my company with the culture that I wanted.

It's been a great process and I've learned so much along the way. 2016 will be about continuing to grow and actually start to advertise our services. 95% of the clients we work with have come to us from word of mouth. Do great work, and new leads just come to you!

This year is going to be phenomenal, and I'm excited to get started!
